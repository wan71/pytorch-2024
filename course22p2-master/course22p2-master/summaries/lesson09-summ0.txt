In this video lesson, titled "Deep Learning Foundations to Stable Diffusion," the instructor introduces Part 2 of the "Practical Deep Learning for Coders" series. The lesson focuses on understanding and using Stable Diffusion, a generative model technique. The instructor emphasizes that this course is more in-depth and requires a stronger foundation in deep learning than Part 1. It is recommended that students complete Part 1 before attempting this course unless they are already comfortable with deep learning basics.

The lesson is divided into two parts: a quick run-through of using Stable Diffusion and a detailed explanation of how it works. The instructor acknowledges that the content may be challenging for those new to deep learning but aims to explain everything as clearly as possible. It is suggested that students spend about 10 hours of work on each video, with some even taking a year-long sabbatical to fully understand the material.

To get started with Stable Diffusion, the instructor recommends using Hugging Face's Diffusers library and their pre-trained pipelines. Students can save and load pipelines to and from the Hugging Face Hub, making it easy to share and collaborate on projects. The instructor demonstrates how to use a pipeline to generate an image based on a text prompt, such as "a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse." By changing the random seed, students can generate different images based on the same prompt.

The instructor also highlights various resources for students to explore, including suggested tools and examples of AI-generated artwork. These resources can help students understand the capabilities and constraints of Stable Diffusion and inspire them to create their own projects.In this section of the video lesson, the instructor demonstrates how to generate images using diffusion models. The process starts with random noise and gradually refines the image through multiple steps to make it more like the desired output. The instructor also discusses the concept of "guidance scale," which determines the degree to which the model should focus on the specific caption versus just creating an image. By adjusting the guidance scale, users can influence the model's output.

The instructor then shows how to use negative prompts to create images with specific characteristics, such as subtracting the color blue from an image. Additionally, the lesson covers how to use image-to-image pipelines to start the diffusion process with a noisy version of a drawing, allowing the model to generate images that match a particular composition.

The instructor discusses fine-tuning models using techniques like textual inversion and Dreambooth. Textual inversion involves training a single embedding to match example images, while Dreambooth fine-tunes an existing token to bring it closer to the provided images. These techniques allow users to generate novel images based on specific prompts and fine-tuned models.In this section of the video lesson, the instructor discusses the concept of using finite differencing to calculate derivatives and introduces the idea of using analytic derivatives instead. They propose creating a new endpoint that calls dot backward and gives dot grad, allowing for the calculation of gradients directly. The goal is to train a neural network to identify which pixels to change to make an image look more like a handwritten digit.

To achieve this, the instructor suggests creating training data with varying levels of noise added to real handwritten digits. Instead of trying to come up with an arbitrary score for how much an image looks like a digit, they propose predicting the amount of noise added. By predicting the noise, they can then subtract it from the input image to obtain a clearer digit. This process is repeated multiple times to improve the digit's appearance.

The instructor then introduces the concept of autoencoders, which are neural networks that can compress images by encoding them into a smaller representation called "latents." By training a U-Net on these latents instead of the full-sized images, the computation time and resources required are significantly reduced. The U-Net takes somewhat noisy latents as input and outputs the noise, which can then be subtracted to obtain the actual latents. These latents can be passed through the decoder of the VAE (Variational Autoencoder) to obtain the final image. This approach is more efficient and cost-effective than working with full-sized images.In the video lesson, the instructor discusses how to generate a specific digit by passing in a one-hot encoded version of the digit along with the noisy input to the neural network. This additional information helps the model predict noise better by knowing the original image. The instructor then explains the challenge of creating a one-hot encoded vector for more complex inputs, such as a cute teddy bear. To overcome this, they introduce the concept of creating a model that can take a sentence and return a vector of numbers representing the image. This is achieved by using two models: a text encoder and an image encoder, which are trained using a contrastive loss function.

The instructor then introduces the CLIP text encoder, which takes text input and outputs an embedding where similar sets of text with similar meanings give similar embeddings. The process of training the model involves randomly picking an image from the training set and a random amount of noise or a "t" value, which determines the amount of noise to use. This trains the model to predict noise, which can then be subtracted from the noisy image to generate the denoised image.

Finally, the instructor discusses the similarities between the diffusion-based models and deep learning optimizers, suggesting that rethinking the problem as an optimization problem rather than a differential equation solving problem could lead to better results. They also mention the possibility of using more sophisticated loss functions, such as perceptual loss, and exploring new research directions. The next lesson will delve deeper into the code behind the pipeline and build up from the foundations using only pure Python and the Python standard library.
